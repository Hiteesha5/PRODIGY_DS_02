# PRODIGY_DS_02
Data Cleaning &amp; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Task Description:
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a structured dataset. The goal is to identify missing values, detect outliers, handle duplicates, and extract meaningful insights through visualizations.

We used the famous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle, which includes passenger details such as:
- Name, Age, Sex
- Pclass (ticket class), Fare, Cabin, Embarked
- Survival status (target variable)

---

### Files Included:
- `titanic_data_cleaning_eda.ipynb` â€“ Google Colab notebook with all data cleaning and EDA steps
- (Dataset not uploaded â€“ download link provided below)

---

### Dataset Source:
- [Titanic Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

---

### Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas (data cleaning & manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

---

### Key Steps Performed:
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Converted data types
   - Label encoding of categorical values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualized survival distribution by gender and age
   - Analyzed class-wise passenger survival
   - Explored correlations between features using a heatmap

---

### Sample Visualizations:
- Bar plots of survival rate by gender and class
- Age distribution histograms
- Correlation heatmaps of numerical features

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
By performing EDA, we gained insights into survival rates and identified which features had the most impact on survival, laying the foundation for future machine learning models.
